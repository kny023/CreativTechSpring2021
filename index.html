    <strong> Quote 1 <br>
        Introduction <br>
        "We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But a digital product is not the same as a printed product." </strong>

        I feel like this quote tells exactly how I felt about the graphic design world and its interesting transition.  I used to hear some designers arguing UIUX or software-related design is one kind of current 'trend', and that sounded imply that traditional way of design such as graphic design is more fundamental and crucial than digital product design. However, I've always thought that the way we deal with graphic design should change as we are now living in a world where people don't consume papers not as much as in the past. And like the author suggested, the way we define and teach graphic design should change as well.
