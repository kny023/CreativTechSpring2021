    <strong> Quote 1 <br>
        Introduction: <br>
        "We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But a digital product is not the same as a printed product." </strong>

    <p>
        It is easy to see in graphic design world that a lot of designers think that the traditional method of design such as editorial design and typography is more fundamental and crucial than digital product design. However, I have always thought that the way we deal with graphic design should change, for we now live in a world where people don't consume as much paper as before. And like the author suggested, the way we define and teach graphic design should change as well.

    <strong> Quote 2 <br>What is a design system?:<br>
        <ins>The MIT Media Lab design system</ins><br> 
        "This logo is an excellent example of how a design system can be used to give both a consistent look and a distinct style to an organization. The system is both simple and flexible, and it has room for an almost infinite number of designs.”
    </strong>

    <p>
        This reminded me of MIT Media Lab’s flexible design that was done in 2005 
        <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1663378/mit-media-labs-brilliant-new-logo-has-40000-permutations-video">MIT Media Lab</a>
        and I still remember how surprised I was knowing that a logo can have many different forms within certain rules. I was fascinated by its visual impact as well as the logic. I think this new logo system of MIT Media Lab had definitely got influenced by their first flexible identity. It’s also interesting to see how they used the grid in the new system because in some way it’s quite similar to how Korean letters being created. <a href="https://centers.ibs.re.kr/html/living_en/overview/korean1.html">Korean Letters</a>

    <strong> Quote 3 <br>
        A short history of color theory: <br>
        "Here, Itten’s personal preferences towards the color palette bleed into an unnecessarily strict generalization about color and subject. Who is to say that yellow stripes or blue polka-dots cannot be used effectively when designing food product labeling?" 
    </strong>

    <p>
        I agree with the author on this argument. Although there might be some psychological theories or reasons that operate our preference of colors, I certainly do agree that making a generalization about color can be unnecessary. It's also the designer's job to make something more appealing and less common and in order to do that, often designers take approaches where they create differently including different choices of colors. So inevitably colors is another element that the designer's subjectivity involves and that's one of the fun parts of the design process as well.
