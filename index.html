    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>The Web as a Rube Goldberg Machine</h3>

    <h3>Reading: "Programming Design Systems" by Rune Madsen</h3>      
    
    <strong> Quote 1 <br>
        “The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and his or her peers. Given that a significant number of women work as journalists and editors, perform surgery, run companies, manage small businesses, and use spreadsheets, that a few even serve on the Supreme Court, and that we are no longer surprised to find women working as accountants, professors, statisticians, or project managers, it’s hard to imagine that they can’t write JavaScript. Programming, despite the hype and the self-serving fantasies of programmers the world over, isn’t the most intellectually demanding task imaginable. Which leads one to the inescapable conclusion: The problem with women in technology isn’t the women.”

        The story of the woman in the IT field was quite intriguing for me, as I had never thought about gender issues in the field seriously before. I only vaguely imagined that the programming field can be somewhat male-centric but this statement really made me wonder why men are more likely to go into the IT field than women. Would there be any scientific reason why more men go into the IT field than women? (maybe the same question can be applied to why there are certain types of subjects or job fields where there is only one gender is dominating, is it something in our nature?)
        And the chart at the bottom of the section was also very provocative as it shows a steady growth of the ratio of men in the IT field whereas women are decreasing dramatically. The unequal distribution of people along the gender line might take its toll on the advancement of the field in general. I feel that it’s something we need to address for a fairer, equitable environment.

    <strong> Quote 2 <br>
        “The industry twists and turns so often, though, that who knows what the next 10 or 20 years will bring? The iPhone, and mobile in general, created a brief renaissance for people who could program using lower-level languages such as Objective-C, people who could worry about a computer’s memory. Perhaps the Internet of Things will turn everything into a sensor. (Already you wander Disney World with a wristband, and it watches and tracks you; the whole place is a computer. Δ) This will require yet more low-level thinking. And then there will be websites to make, apps to build, and on and on.”
    </strong>

        I can somewhat agree with this statement since everything changes so fast in the IT industry. I also sometimes wonder how the world might change in the next 10 or more years and what the role of the people in the IT industry might be in bringing about the dramatic transformations. It also reminds me of some of the concerns that my friends who are working as an engineer shared, namely that the fast-changing world makes it almost impossible for them to make any valid, educated predictions. I also wonder what “low-level thinking”  has to do with IoT turning everything into a sensor at the last argument.

    <strong> Quote 3 <br>
        “The greatest commercial insight of the technology industry is that if you control a computing environment, you can move the market. You can change the way people do things, the way they listen to music, watch videos, and respond to advertising. People who work at technology companies are supposed to take an idea and multiply it by a few million people, yielding a few billion dollars.”

        It really rings true for me if we think about such examples as Youtube or Netflix. Those platforms literally revolutionized the way people consume media. About 10 years ago it was hard to imagine living without TV but now these days people spend more time watching videos from the internet. Also, it is possible for people to upload the videos they created, which highlights the interactive nature of the newly emerging platforms. There has been a report suggesting that the amount of time people spend on public broadcasting has been reduced, because of the popularity of other online platforms that provide much diverse content. This trend might continue and it’s exciting to think about what kind of technology will change the market in the future.
