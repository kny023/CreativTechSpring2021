    <strong> Quote 1 <br>
        Introduction <br>
        "We now spend a majority of our time looking at screens instead of paper, and this has created a great need for designers who understand how to design for digital devices. But a digital product is not the same as a printed product." </strong>

    <p>
        It is easy to see in graphic design world that a lot of designers think that the traditional method of design such as editorial design and typography is more fundamental and crucial than digital product design. However, I have always thought that the way we deal with graphic design should change, for we now live in a world where people don't consume as much paper as before. And like the author suggested, the way we define and teach graphic design should change as well.
